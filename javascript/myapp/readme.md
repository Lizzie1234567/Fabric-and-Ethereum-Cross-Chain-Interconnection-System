With the continuous development of society, electronic health records are more and more widely used in the medical system. But the current electronic health record system is centralized, and the data of patients in many hospitals are not interoperable. This has led to many drawbacks in the current medical system.

As of today, critical patient data, case and test information were still scattered among different medical institutions. Due to the inefficiencies of the current system, critical data 
cannot be accessed or obtained when needed. At the same time, the systems of many medical 
institutions are not complete, and the data management of most medical institutions is still very 
difficult, which makes the personal data management process difficult.

Nowadays since the electronic health records are stored centrally on the hospital's server, 
the system administrator can unconditionally modify any patient information, and we cannot 
trace back to the person who modified the patient information. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out 
that some immoral doctors maliciously modify patient information for their own benefit. In fact, 
due to the huge amount of electronic medical record data, the hospital will delete some patient 
information from time to time, so there are often cases where some patients' condition records 
are not perfect, which affects the doctor's diagnosis of the patient's condition.

Therefore, we decided to apply blockchain technology to electronic health records to 
design a decentralized health record system that can protect the integrity of patient information 
and data from malicious tampering, and it can trace the patient's attending doctor. The 
requirements are as follows:

⚫ Patient information, such as id, description, etc. can be recorded in detail.

⚫ Patient information cannot be modified maliciously.

⚫ Doctors can add, delete, modify and check four main functions of medical records.

⚫ Doctors can use the system only after logging in.

⚫ Different doctors have different permissions, and only the attending doctor can change 
the patient information.

⚫ When the search information is incomplete, relevant information can also be searched.

⚫ Ensure that doctors are responsible for patients, and if there is a problem with the 
medical records, the attending doctor can be accurately identified.

⚫ For hospitals that use Dapps on different platforms (Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric), 
data can still be shared.
