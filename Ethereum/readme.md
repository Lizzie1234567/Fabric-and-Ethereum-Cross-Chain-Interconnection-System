We designed a smart contract on health record system using solidity language and 
deployed it in Ethereum, and the actual testing of the system was done using Ganache blockchain.

Our health record system is aimed for doctors. Doctors are users in this system in fact. 
They firstly should register, and input username and password. Then they should log in to use this system.

Execute:

truffle compile

compile
2_deploy_migration.js has been modified and added to the folder
connect ganache
truffle migrate
Execute index.js to realize addition, deletion, modification and query
